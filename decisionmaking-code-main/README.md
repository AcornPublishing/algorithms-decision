# decisionmaking-code
*Mykel Kochenderfer, Tim Wheeler, and Kyle Wray*

All typeset code blocks from the book, [Algorithms for Decision Making](https://algorithmsbook.com/).

We share this content in the hopes that it helps you and makes the decision making algorithms
more approachable and accessible. Thank you for reading!

If you encounter any issues or have pressing comments, please [file an issue](https://github.com/algorithmsbooks/decisionmaking/issues/new/choose).

## Python

Griffin Holt has been translating these algorithms into Python. 
While it is recommended that students learn Julia syntax to follow along with the book, those needing a Python reference can refer to [decisionmaking-code-py](https://github.com/griffinbholt/decisionmaking-code-py).
